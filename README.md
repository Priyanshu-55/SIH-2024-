ðŸŽ“ Inclusive Learning App for Deaf and Mute Students
Overview
This mobile application aims to revolutionize the learning experience for deaf and mute students in Gujarat by integrating Indian Sign Language (ISL) and advanced technologies. Our interactive platform offers engaging lessons in language, mathematics, and science, featuring a 3D avatar to demonstrate sign language for each topic.

Key Features
3D Avatar Demonstration: A virtual avatar that teaches using ISL.
Live Gesture Tracking: Students can practice in real-time and receive immediate feedback.
Speech-to-Sign Language Conversion: Facilitates communication between students and teachers.
Digital Whiteboard: Allows for interactive writing exercises and note-taking.
Inclusive Communication: Bridges gaps between students, parents, teachers, and HR executives.

Usage
Open the application on your device.
Select a subject (language, mathematics, or science).
Interact with the 3D avatar and practice gestures.
Utilize the digital whiteboard for exercises.
Provide or receive feedback through the live gesture tracking feature.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Flutter
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Machine Learning: Python, TensorFlow, Keras (LSTM model for gesture recognition)
3D Modeling: Blender or similar software for avatar creation
Real-time Communication: WebSockets


Dataset Collection
Our dataset is curated specifically for this project, incorporating a diverse range of sign language gestures and contextual examples. The dataset includes:

Video recordings of native ISL signers.
Annotated gesture data for training the LSTM model.
Collaborative input from educators and sign language experts.
How to Contribute to the Dataset
Record and share new sign language gestures.
Provide feedback on existing gesture classifications.
Collaborate with local ISL communities for additional data.
